We demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 infection attenuates pancreatic insulin levels and secretion and induces β cell apoptosis, each rescued by NRP1 inhibition.

In primary cultures of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), SARS-CoV-2 S protein enhanced in a concentration-dependent manner the cellular content of senescence and DNA damage response markers (senescence-associated-β galactosidase, γH2AX), as well as growth-arrest effectors (p53, p21, p16). In parallel, the S protein reduced the availability of cytoprotective proteins, such as the anti-aging protein klotho, Nrf2 or heme oxygenase-1, and caused functional harm by impairing ex vivo endothelial-dependent vasorelaxation in murine microvessels."
